# Exercise 2 - Stopwatch :watch:

### Duration
`1.5 days`

### Code Review
`Trainer + 1`

## Summary
In this exercise, we dive deeper into styling our React app and adding some logic -  Using intervals, state and a little bit of component seperation and folder hierarchy.

### Guidelines
`Did I hear react hooks?`

## Tasks
* User Interface
    * Timer
    * Stop/Start Buttons
* Each component has it's own relevant state, and *lift your state* up when needed
* Make sure you follow concepts like seperation of concerns, and a component is not a god-component that does everything.
* Disposing intervals?
