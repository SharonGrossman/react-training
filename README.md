# React Training
### Introduction
The frontend ecosystem is huge. Itâ€™s full with technologies rising every day from AngularJS to Angular to React to Vuejs and so on.

<b>Why are we choosing to focus on React?</b>

React as of this day, is the king of frontend with a lot of support from the father company of Facebook, and a huge community. There are a lot of modules, tutorials, boilerplates and documentation.

Obviously, we should build our projects to be modular enough to switch to another technology if needed, but for now React is a powerful library with a set of libraries that support and surround it to bring a full blown architecture to life.

<b>How?</b>

During the training, you are required to read a lot, and explore the various paradigms, concepts and patterns of React.
These exercises will give you a basic undestanding and practice in React, and later on some deeper concepts and more complex app structure and logic.

<b>Is this training enough?</b>

No.

The javascript ecosystem is enormous, full of patterns, modules, materials to read and projects to explore, this training will give you an overview of basic & somewhat intermediate concepts in React but you cannot stop there. Practice, read blogs, follow developers on Twitter and keep on studying and learning more technologies and concepts, and be sure to stay updated with the latest tech and innovations in the React and javascript world.
